### FAQ

**What's the deal?**

Bring your comp or laptop. We'll play some games at my place. Be my friend on steam, I'm `strangercannon`

**Is it okay to suck?**

Yes, I am the absolute worst at DOTA. I once tried to play online and the kids there are so mean. The mean-ness of high-schoolers online is directly inverse to skill, so now you know what you are working with. I also have never played CS:GO in my life (but played a little CS back in the day)

**Will I have fun?**

Absolute fun is guaranteed or your money back*

*You will get no money so don't even start with me

**Who all is coming?**

Dude I dont even know just come on over and let's play some games
